# test-grpc-return-statuses
A basic grpc service able to return all the possible GRPC statuses by request, initially for testing BloomRPC

Dotnet sdk 6 is the only requirement.
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download

The nugets should get downloaded automatically.
If not, then try downloading nuget and running it once: https://www.nuget.org/downloads
During a dry run it should add default nuget sources, which are used by dotnet as well.

Run from the repo root:
```
dotnet run
```
